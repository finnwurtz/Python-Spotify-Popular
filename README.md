# Python-Spotify-Popular
This program uses the Pandas library to identify the artists whose music appears most frequently in Spotify's curated playlists.

Technologies Used: Python, Pandas, Jupyter Notebooks, Spotipy, Spotify API

This program consists of three [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks. The first notebook uses the [Spotipy Library](https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/2.16.0/) to query the [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/), thereby extracting information about each of the playlists that Spotify curates and promotes using its [eponymous user account](https://open.spotify.com/user/spotify). It then loads this information into a CSV file (all_playlists). Next, the second notebook extracts follower counts for all of these playlists, ranks the playlists by follower count, and loads a list of the most followed playlists into a second CSV file (top_100_playlists). Finally, the third notebook counts the number of times that each artist appears in the list of most followed playlists, ranks the artists accordingly, and loads a list of the top 100 artists into a third CSV file (top_100_artists). The resulting data provide insight into the state of popular music on one of the world's most popular music streaming platforms.
