# Python-Spotify-Popular
This program uses the Pandas library to identify the artists whose music dominates Spotify's curated playlists.

Technologies Used: Python, Pandas, Jupyter Notebooks, Spotipy, Spotify API

This program consists of three Jupyter notebooks. The first notebook uses the [Spotipy Library](https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/2.16.0/) to query the [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/) so that it can extract information about the hundreds of playlists that Spotify curates and promotes via its eponymous user account. This notebook then loads this information into a CSV database (all_playlists). Next, the second notebook extracts follower counts for each of these playlists, ranks the playlists by follower count, and loads a list of the most followed playlists into a second CSV database (top_100_playlists). Finally, the third notebook counts the number of times that each artist appears in the list of most followed playlists, ranks the artists accordingly, and loads a list of the top 100 artists into a third CSV database (top_100_artists). The resulting data sheds light on the state of popular music on one of the world's most widely used music streaming platforms.
