# Python-Spotify-Popular
This program uses the Pandas library to identify the artists whose music dominates Spotify's curated playlists.

Technologies Used: Python, Pandas, Jupyter Notebooks, Spotipy, Spotify API

In this program, the first notebook uses the [Spotipy](https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/2.16.0/) library to query the [Spotify](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/) API so that it can extract information about the hundreds of playlists that Spotify curates and promotes via its eponymous user account. The notebook then loads this information into a CSV database (all_playlists). Next, the second notebook extracts follower counts for each of these playlists, ranks the playlists by popularity, and loads a list of the most popular playlists into a second CSV database (top_100_playlists). Finally, the third notebook counts the number of times that each artist appears in the list of most popular playlists, ranks the artists accordingly, and loads a list of the most popular artists into a third CSV database (top_100_artists). The resulting data sheds light on the state of popular music on one of the world's most popular music streaming platforms.

When this program was run on October 12th, 2020:

  The 5 most popular Spotify-curated playlists were Today's Top Hits, RapCaviar, Hot Country, Â¡Viva Latino!, and New Music Friday

  The 5 most popular artists within the top 100 Spotify-curated playlists were Drake, The Beatles, The Weeknd, Justin Bieber, and Coldplay
