# Python-Spotify-Popular
This program uses the Pandas library to identify the artists whose music dominates Spotify's curated playlists.

Technologies Used: Python, Pandas, Jupyter Notebooks, Spotipy, Spotify API

In this program, the first notebook uses the [Spotipy](https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/2.16.0/) library to query the [Spotify](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/) API so that it can extract information about the hundreds of playlists that Spotify curates and promotes via its eponymous user account. The notebook then loads this information into a CSV database (all_playlists). Next, the second notebook extracts follower counts for each of these playlists, ranks the playlists by popularity, and loads a list of the most popular playlists into a second CSV database (top_100_playlists). Finally, the third notebook counts the number of times that each artist appears in the list of most popular playlists, ranks the artists accordingly, and loads a list of the most popular artists into a third CSV database (top_100_artists). The resulting data sheds light on the state of popular music on one of the world's most popular music streaming platforms.

Listed below are the outputs from this program as of October 12th, 2020.
