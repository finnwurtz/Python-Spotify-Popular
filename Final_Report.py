#For this project, I used the first notebook
#to query each of the hundreds of playlists
#that spotify curates and promotes via its
#eponymous user account. I then saved this
#list of playlists as a database formatted
#as a comma-separated value (CSV) file. Next, 
#I used the second notebook to obtain the 
#follower counts for each of these playlists, 
#which allowed me to create another CSV 
#database where I stored the one hundred most 
#popular of these playlists when measured by 
#follower count. Finally, I used the third 
#notebook to count the number of times that 
#each artist appeared in these one hundred 
#playlists, which allowed me to create a 
#third CSV database where the most popular 
#artists are ranked by how many times they 
#appear. The final databases (Playlist_Merge 
#and Artist_Finder) provide insights into the 
#nature of musical popularity as it exists on 
#one of the worldâ€™s most popular streaming 
#platforms
