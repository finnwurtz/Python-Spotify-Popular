\
For this project, I used the first notebook to query each of the hundreds of playlists that spotify curates and promotes via its eponymous user account. I then saved this list of playlists as a database formatted as a comma-separated value (CSV) file. Next, I used the second notebook to obtain the follower counts for each of these playlists, which allowed me to create another CSV database where I stored the one hundred most popular of these playlists when measured by follower count. Finally, I used the third notebook to count the number of times that each artist appeared in these one hundred playlists, which allowed me to create a third CSV database where the most popular artists are ranked by how many times they appear. The final databases \'97 Playlist_Merge and Artist_Finder \'97 provide insights into the nature of musical popularity as it exists on one of the world\'92s most popular streaming platforms}
